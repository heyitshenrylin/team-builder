# Team Builder
### Final project for ICS4U

Authors: David Haighton, Henry Lin

## Dependencies

Team Builder is an extension for Google Chrome. Please pack the extension and
ensure developer mode is enabled under the extensions tab in Chrome before
uploading.

To use the Team Builder you will need to activate the Google Sheets API found
[here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/).

## Functionality

### ✔ Simple pop-up interface

After clicking the extension button on the toolbar, a simple and effective
pop-up demonstrates the Team Builder's functionality.

### ✔ Ease of access

The primary concern for the client was accessibility. As a Chrome extension, the
client's concerns have been resolved as the Team Builder is right on your Chrome
toolbar.

### ✔ Google Sheets integration

Instead of hosting a personal server, the Google Sheets API stores your name
data for ease of access as well as having all the security benefits of Google.

### ✔ Meeting client demands

Team Builder was custom-made for [Jasmine Larocque](jasmine.larocque@ocdsb.ca),
meeting multiple times before the final released version to satisfy demands.

## Issues With Release v.1.0

* Pop-up and proceeding page are not as aesthetically pleasing as we would have
 liked

* Team Builder application is not on the Chrome Extension search

* Modularization problems
